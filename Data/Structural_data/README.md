Files used for structural analyses. These include:

- 2rk1.pdb: Raw PDB file with the asymmetric unit (monomer) for DfrB1 from the PDB.

- 2rk1_bio.pdb: PDB file with the biological assembly for DfrB1 from the PDB, derived using REMARK 350 from 2rk1.pdb and the 
001_generate_bio_assembly.py script.

- Dfrb1_6ca29_unrelaxed_rank_1_model_1.pdb: AlphaFold2 model for the full sequence of DfrB1. Generated by submitting the
sequence of the tetramer (separating the subunits with ":") to CollabFold
(https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb)

- DfrB1_alphafold_rank1_2RK1Coords.pdb: AlphaFold2 model translated to the coordinates of the biological assembly of 2rk1 using
a structural alignment.

- DHFR_2rk1_DSSP_table_bio_rSASA.txt: Values for relative solvent accessibility for the biological assembly of 2RK1.

- DHFR_2rk1_from_file_bio.dssp: Results from the DSSP analysis using the biological assembly of 2RK1 as input.

- model1_pLDDT: pLDDT values from the AlphaFold2 model of DfrB1
