This folder contains the script used to train and validate the random forest model for the expression-dependent
differences in fitness effects at weak and optimal expression (deltaS_weak). The script is shown both as a Jupyter
notebook and as a standalone Python script.

It uses the dataset in Data/Complete_datasets/dataset_diffNorm_ara0.2_ara0.01_index_differences.txt and produces
the result files in the Data/Random_forest_results folder.
